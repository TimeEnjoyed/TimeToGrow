===================================================================
BASIC EXAMPLE
- USER BUYS SEEDS WITH POINTS (50pts) (twitchapi <-websocket-> twitchio)
- (twitchio <-built into each other-> starlette server)
- Creates user in table in database. (sqlite - asynchronous via wrapper https://github.com/Rapptz/asqlite)
- Questions: attributes of user?
- Grab seeds.jpg and display on template.



===================================================================
Three parts
1) This should work from command line- Growth Plant Program (state)

2) The Server Problem - connect user to program
twitchAPI - connects to events such as: redemption points, follows, subs

3) How to display via HTML
 -prob need js y/n


starlette receives the request into a function.
def receive_redemption(?)
    # create user in database
    # returns user object

Process/thinking aloud:
- redeem event --> request ( username, type of redemption) POST.


- Server Side Event



User on Twitch Redeems > TwitchIO Recieves Redemption >
TwitchIO does whatever you want with API and puts data into queue >
 Starlette receives data from queue >
 Starlette sends an event to all subscribed listeners
